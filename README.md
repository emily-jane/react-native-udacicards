# UdaciCards

Welcome to the React Native 'UdaciCards' app! It is a quiz app that tests you on whatever you need help on! Happy quizzing :)

### Installation

Fork this repo, then (assuming you have npm) do the following:

```
npm install
```

### Getting Started

Once you've done the above, just type the following:

```
yarn start
```

Then just scan the barcode using the Expo app and you're good to go!

### General Use
On the main decks page you will see a list of your current decks and the number of question cards in each deck. On the New Deck tab you can also add a new deck to your list. On the individual deck page you can add a new question, delete the deck or get cracking and start the quiz! Each question is a flip card with the answer on the back, and the ability to store whether you got the quesiton right or wrong. Once the quiz is finished you will get your overall score for that quiz and can then restart or go back to the main deck page. If you don't complete a quiz that day you will get a notification reminder at 8pm to remind you to keep quizzing :)
